=======================

Welcome to the official Service2Media github pages! Here you'll find all opensource stuff that you can freely download, 
use, include, redistribute or whatever you want. Please note that repository purely serves as the base for Github pages 
which means that you'll find no code here, only the help page and documentation

=Public repositories
You can start using the following repositories:
1. m2active-script-components --> reusable M2Active components (script only, no native code included)
2. m2active-tools --> handy shell-scripts and in the future, probably even more shell-scripts :)
