        <p>Welcome to the official Service2Media github pages! Here you'll find all opensource stuff that you can freely download, 
use, include, redistribute or whatever you want. Please note that this repository purely serves as the base for Github pages 
which means that you'll find no code here (yuck!), only the help page and general documentation...</p>

<a name="public-repositories" class="anchor" href="#public-repositories"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Public repositories</h1>

<p>Currently we serve the following repositories:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/service2media/m2active-script-components">https://github.com/service2media/m2active-script-components</a> || reusable M2Active components (script only, no native code included)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/service2media/m2active-tools">https://github.com/service2media/m2active-tools</a> || M2Active package + in the future handy shell-scripts and probably even more shell-scripts :)</li>
</ol><h1>
<a name="getting-started-with-git" class="anchor" href="#getting-started-with-git"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting started with git</h1>

<p>There are two ways to get started. First if you are an experienced git user you probably don't need to read this 
and probably want to clone the m2active-script-components repository right ahead. </p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/service2media/m2active-script-components
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously you'll need the git command-line tooling. You can find the available script components here and start adding
those to your project</p>

<h1>
<a name="getting-start-with-the-m2active-package-manager-mpm" class="anchor" href="#getting-start-with-the-m2active-package-manager-mpm"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting start with the M2Active Package Manager (MPM)</h1>

<p>To make downloading and installing a little bit easier, there is a package manager called mpm available. This basically 
allows you to download and add a specific version tot your project. </p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/service2media/m2active-tools
$ cd m2active-tools
$ ./install.sh
$ ./env.sh (only for the current shell)
</code></pre>

<p>That's about it! You can use mpm from within your $PATH. If you want the solution to stick, append the contents of env.sh
to your PATH (Mac Os X and Linux) using .bashrc or .bash_profile.</p>
